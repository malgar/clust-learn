# Guides

This section contains five guides to help users get started with `clust-learn`. These guides are in `ipynb` and `html` format.

_Note_ that the guides are designed so that the output of the data processing guide is subsequently used in the dimensionality reduction guide, and so on.

## Table of guides

| Guide | Module | Description |
|:-|:-|:-|
| [`data_preprocessing_guide_default`](link) | [`data_preprocessing`](https://github.com/malgar/clust-learn/tree/master/clearn/data_preprocessing) | Perform data preprocessing in default mode. Recommended for beginners. |
| [`data_preprocessing_guide_custom`](link) | [`data_preprocessing`](https://github.com/malgar/clust-learn/tree/master/clearn/data_preprocessing) | Perform data preprocessing step by step with options to customize data imputation. Recommended for users who are familiar with the methodology. |
| [`dimensionality_reduction_guide`](link) | [`dimensionality_reduction`](https://github.com/malgar/clust-learn/tree/master/clearn/dimensionality_reduction) | Perform dimensionality reduction and explain how the new derived variables explain the original ones. |
| [`clustering_guide`](link)  | [`clustering`](https://github.com/malgar/clust-learn/tree/master/clearn/clustering) | Perfom cluster analysis, assess performance, and explain the obtained clusters with internal and external variables. |
| [`classifier_guide`](link) | [`classifier`](https://github.com/malgar/clust-learn/tree/master/clearn/classifier) | Perform classification, assess model performance, and explain results using SHAP values. This guide shows how to use the module to further explain the clusters obtained in the `clustering_guide`; however, the module may be used to fit any classificaton model |


## Data

The data used in the five guides is available [here](link). You can find the output generated by each guide; these are used:
- as input of the subsequent modules,
- for reproducibility purposes.


## Reproducibility

We have made the output of each module available for reproducibility purposes. Note that the `numpy` seed is set in each module to ensure that the same results are generated.

The guides were originally run on a 64-bit Microsoft Operating System.
