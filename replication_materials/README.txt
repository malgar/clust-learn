Replication code
================

1) Install the package via pip

	pip install clust-learn


2) Run script

The illustrative example from the paper can be replicated using the
script "paper_script.py". 

	1. Open a command prompt
	2. On the command prompt, change directory to the one where the script is located
	3. Run:
		python paper_script.py
		
Numerical outputs (inclusing tables / data frames) will be displayed on the
command prompt. Figures will be saved in a directory called "img".

Input data is available in the "data" folder, and can also be found
[here](https://github.com/malgar/clust-learn/tree/master/notebooks/data).

Note Python 3.9 is required. Other library dependencies / requirements are 
automatically managed when the package is installed.

Please, read the Annex B. Supplementary material and computational details.
